# Inventory-Management-System
## Project Overview

The Inventory Management System is designed to streamline inventory operations by providing insights into stock levels, sales trends, and reordering processes. The system utilizes Python, SQL, and Tableau to analyze and visualize inventory data.


### Step 1: Understand the Dataset
**Objective**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure and key columns.

**Actions Completed**:
- Loaded and inspected the dataset using Python libraries (`pandas`).
- Cleaned data by handling missing values and inconsistencies.
- Identified key columns:
  - Product IDs
  - Stock levels
  - Sales data
  - Order dates

**Next Steps**:
- Design the SQL database schema.
- Define relationships between `Products`, `Sales`, and `Inventory` tables.
